# 🫀 Heart Disease Risk Analysis with EDA and Prediction

## 📌 Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the presence of heart disease using real-world medical data. Using the UCI Heart Disease dataset, it walks through a complete data science workflow — from data loading and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and logistic regression modeling.

The goal is to identify key medical indicators that contribute to heart disease and to build a model that can predict its presence.

---

## 🔍 Objectives
- Perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover health patterns.
- Visualize medical features (age, cholesterol, chest pain, etc.) using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Build a logistic regression model to classify patients as at-risk or not.
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci)
- **Description**: Contains 14 attributes including patient age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, and target label indicating presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of heart disease.

---

## 📈 Key Steps
1. **Import libraries** and load dataset
2. **Clean and explore** the data
3. Visualize trends using **heatmaps, histograms, boxplots**
4. Build and train a **Logistic Regression** model
5. Evaluate using **confusion matrix** and **classification report**

---

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## 📊 Example Insights
- **Age** and **cholesterol** levels are strongly associated with heart disease.
- Certain **chest pain types** and **ECG results** are key indicators.
- Logistic Regression provides a solid baseline model for classification.

---

## ✅ Results
- Model accuracy: ~`XX%` (update after testing)
- Confusion matrix and classification report help visualize performance.
- Feature importance analysis shows key contributors to heart disease.

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Try advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost
- Apply hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Deploy using Streamlit or Flask
- Add feature selection and scaling pipelines

---

## 📌 How to Use
1. Clone the repository or open in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset (`heart.csv`)
3. Run each cell to analyze and model the data
4. Modify and experiment with different models
